# FreeCAD Assembly 4 workbench

Current 0.10.2, 2021-08-29



## Overview

This assembly workbench allows to assemble into a single Part container under a single coordinate system other FreeCAD objects using Links, and place them relative to the assembly and to each-other. The parts in the assembly can invariably be in the same document as the assembly or in an external document.

As an Assembly4 _Model_ is a standard FreeCAD `App::Part` container, it can be used and manipulated with any FreeCAD tool handling `App::Part` objects. In particular, it can be inserted into another Assembly4 _Model_ to create nested assemblies. It can also contain solids and datum objects. An Assembly4 _Model_ can be a stand-alone part, an assembly, a sub-assembly, and any combinations of these.

Parts and linked parts are placed to each-other in the host parent assembly by matching their Datum Coordinate Systems (called LCS for Local Coordinate System) using the built-in FreeCAD *ExpressionEngine.* No geometry is used to place and constrain parts relative to each other, thus avoiding a lot of the topological naming problems.

**Please Note:** objects in the same document as the linked part but outside the `App::Part` container will **not** be inserted.

**Please Note:** only _Part_ and _Body_ containers at the root of a document can be inserted. Objects nested inside containers cannot be used directly by Assembly4. 



## Installation

### Addon Manager (recommended)

Assembly 4 is available through the FreeCAD Addon Manager (menu **Tools > Addon Manager**). It is called _Assembly4_ in the Addon Repository.  

**Important Note:** Assembly 4 needs FreeCAD v0.19 or above. Assembly4 is **not** compatible with FreeCAD v0.18 and before. Pre-built binaries on the v0.19 development branch can be found [here](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.19_pre)




## Getting Started

You can get more information in the [user instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md), the [technical manual](TECHMANUAL.md), and you can use the provided [example assemblies](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples) to experiment with this workbench's features. There are also online tutorials :

* [a quick assembly from scratch](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/blob/master/Asm4_Tutorial1/README.md)
* [a cinematic assembly in one file, using a master sketch](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/blob/master/Asm4_Tutorial2/README.md)
* [a Lego assembly](https://github.com/Zolko-123/FreeCAD_Examples/blob/master/Asm4_Tutorial3/README.md)
